# Javascript-String-Checker
A small tool for checking strings in an HTML page. 

Currently, it simply takes the current webpage and matches the "regex" variable to the HTML returned by the first line. 

# Future Plans
- Receive the HTML code via and HTTP request
- Loop the script through an array of URLs
- Return a value confirming the presence of the regex string.
