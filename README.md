# Javascript-QA Script ToolKit (formerly a string checker)
A QA toolkit for websites and webapps using login info with the correct querySelectors, intended for internal use. 

Currently, it simply takes the current webpage and matches the "regex" variable to the HTML returned by the first line.

# To use it

Just paste the string you're searching for in the "regex" variable.

# Future Plans
- Receive the HTML code via and HTTP request
- Loop the script through an array of URLs
- Return a value confirming the presence of the regex string.
