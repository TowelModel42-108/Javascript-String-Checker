# Javascript-QA Script (formerly a string checker)
A small tool for checking strings in an HTML page.

Currently, it simply takes the current webpage and matches the "regex" variable to the HTML returned by the first line.

# To use it

Just paste the string you're searching for in the "regex" variable.

# Future Plans
- Receive the HTML code via and HTTP request
- Loop the script through an array of URLs
- Return a value confirming the presence of the regex string.
